                            that cyber threats don't adhere to a schedule, and neither should your security measures. By
                            consistently detecting vulnerabilities, we ensure that your organization is fortified
                            against potential threats.</p>

                            highlight specific blind spots that may go unnoticed in traditional assessments. Threat
                            actors often exploit these overlooked vulnerabilities. With FSVI, we leave no stone
                            unturned, providing explicit trust in the detection of vulnerabilities that could be
                            exploited.</p>
